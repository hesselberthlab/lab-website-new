**[Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/biochemistry) and [RNA Bioscience Initiative](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/rbi), [University of Colorado School of Medicine](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/)**

We are a group of RNA biologists, technology developers, and data analysts on a mission to discover fundamental principles of RNA regulation and apply them in creative ways to improve human health.

The broad goals of our laboratory are to:

- Understand how RNA damage and repair are integrated with stress responses (funded by an [NIGMS MIRA](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/FWmPa7DGuk6CmPb8Ocb5XQ/project-details/10193187))
- Develop new molecular methods that enhance single-cell and spatial gene expression experiments (funded by an [NIH Transformative R01](https://commonfund.nih.gov/tra/recipients))
- Develop and apply novel RNA therapeutics that modulate gene expression (funded by the RNA Bioscience Initiative)
