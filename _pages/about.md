We are a group of RNA biologists, technology developers, and data analysts 
focused on discovering and translating fundamental principles of RNA regulation.

The broad goals of our laboratory are to:

- Understand how RNA damage and repair are integrated with stress responses
(funded by an [NIGMS
MIRA](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/FWmPa7DGuk6CmPb8Ocb5XQ/project-details/10193187))
- Develop new molecular methods that enhance single-cell and spatial gene
expression experiments (funded by an [NIH Transformative
R01](https://commonfund.nih.gov/tra/recipients))
- Develop and apply RNA therapeutics and vaccines that modulate gene expression, funded
by the [RNA Bioscience Initiative](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/rbi), an award
from [AB Nexus](https://www.cu.edu/ab-nexus/ab-nexus-grant-awardees), the
[Cancer League of Colorado](https://www.cancerleague.org/), and a collaborative
[CU ASPIRE](https://research.cuanschutz.edu/research-ppg/cu-anschutz-som-programmatic-incubator-for-research-(cu-aspire)-program) grant.

A major effort in the lab focuses on the biology of RNA damage and repair using a
combination of method development, bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry, and
cell biology. Over the past ten years we have developed [new sequencing
approaches](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26001965/) to identify damaged RNAs
and [new model systems](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29212664/) with which to
understand the causes and consequences of RNA damage. Our studies have led to
[new concepts](https://elifesciences.org/articles/42262) in post-transcriptional
regulation that have broad implications for understanding the role of RNA damage
in biology.

A second effort focuses on the development of novel technologies for
analysis of additional phenotypes in single-cell and spatial gene
expression approaches. Our recent advances include the [measurement of
enzyme activity and inhibition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286626/)
in single-cell assays, [tracking of ligands and associated gene expression
responses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33843587/) through animal
tissue, and approaches for quantifying metabolite levels.

The newest efforts in the lab focus on RNA therapeutics and vaccines. One is a collaboration
with clinicians at Colorado Children's Hospital to develop RNA therapies for
treatment of pediatric neurological diseases. A second area of emphasis is on
development of mRNA vaccines that promote unique immune responses for
therapeutic purposes.

Finally, we host the [Informatics
Fellows](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/rbi/training-and-education/informatics-fellows-program)
of the RNA Bioscience Initiative, who develop and apply bioinformatic approaches
with investigators across our campus to enable widespread deployment of
new RNA analysis technologies.
