The broad goals of our laboratory are to:

- Understand how RNA damage and repair are integrated with stress responses
- Develop new molecular methods that enhance single-cell and spatial gene expression experiments
- Develop and apply novel RNA therapeutics that modulate gene expression 

We are part of the [RNA Bioscience Initiative]() at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.
