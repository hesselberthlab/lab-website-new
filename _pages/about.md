🤝 We are a collaborative research laboratory of RNA biologists, technology developers, and data analysts
focused on discovering and translating fundamental principles of RNA regulation.

🧬 A major focus in the lab is to understand protein translation through the lens
of transfer RNA (tRNA). Transfer RNAs link the RNA and protein worlds, and our
new approaches enable us to tackle questions using new technologies, including
the application of nanopore analysis to understand the dynamic use of tRNA by cells.

⚕︎ Our newest efforts focus on RNA therapeutics. We work with
with clinicians at Children's Hospital Colorado to develop RNA therapies for
pediatric genetic diseases, and with immunologists and virologists to
develop new ways to manipulate and understand the mammalian immune system.
