We are a research laboratory of RNA biologists, technology developers, and data analysts 
focused on discovering and translating fundamental principles of RNA regulation.

A major effort in the lab is to **understand how RNA damage and repair are integrated with stress responses**
by combining method development, bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry, and
cell biology. We developed [new sequencing
approaches](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26001965/) to identify damaged RNAs
and [new model systems](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29212664/) to
understand the causes and consequences of RNA damage. Our studies have led to
[new concepts](https://elifesciences.org/articles/42262) in post-transcriptional
regulation with broad implications for understanding the role of RNA damage and repair.

A second focus is on **molecular tools that expand the capabilities of single-cell and spatial 
transcriptomic experiments**. Our recent advances include the [measurement of
enzyme activity and inhibition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286626/)
in single-cell assays, [tracking of ligands and associated gene expression
responses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33843587/) through animal
tissue.

Our newest efforts focus on **RNA therapeutics and vaccines**. One is a collaboration
with clinicians at Children's Hospital Colorado to develop RNA therapies for
pediatric neurological diseases, and a second emphasis is on
development of mRNA vaccines that promote unique immune responses.
