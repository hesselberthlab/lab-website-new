## Undergraduates

We participate in summer research experiences offered by the [RNA Bioscience
Initiative](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/rbi/training-and-education/summer-internship-program/about)
and the [CU Cancer
Center](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/colorado-cancer-center/education/creu-program-resources).
See those sites for details.

## Graduate students

We welcome new graduate students interested in projects focused on RNA
biology, technology development, RNA therapeutics, and computational
biology. A feature of student projects in our lab is that they usually
span "wet" and "dry" approaches, from molecular analysis of RNA and RNA
sequencing to the analysis of large DNA sequencing data sets.

We value perspectives of people from all backgrounds and are committed to
providing a equitable and inclusive training environment free of bias and
discrimination.

## Postdoctoral fellows

We are always looking for talented and curious postdoctoral fellows are also hiring in the [RBI Informatics Fellows
program](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/rbi/funding-opportunities/rbi-informatics-fellows-program).
