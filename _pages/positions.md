### Undergraduates

We participate in summer research experiences offered by the RNA
Bioscience Initiative and the CU Cancer Center. See those sites for
details.

### Graduate students

We are accepting new graduate students for projects focused on RNA
biology, technology development, RNA therapeutics, and computational
biology.

Projects in the lab often combine "wet" and "dry" skill sets. While you
don't need to be skilled in both starting out, you can bet you'll be
skilled in both when you leave! 

### Postdoctoral fellows

We are always looking for talented and curious postdoctoral fellows.
Please contact Jay directly to discuss opportunities.
