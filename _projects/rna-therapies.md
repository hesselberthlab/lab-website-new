### RNA therapies for pediatric neurogenetic diseases

Recent successes in the design, delivery, and regulatory use of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies
have set the stage for large-scale ASO development and deployment to treat specific mutations in individuals
with neurologic diseases. Splice-switching ASOs can restore productive splicing for targeted mRNAs: the ASO
therapy nusinersen targets SMN2 pre-mRNA to drive inclusion of a normally skipped exon, yielding a
therapeutic increase in SMN protein levels in motor neurons of spinal muscular atrophy patients. More
recently, development of an ASO to restore CLN7 mRNA splicing in a Batten disease patient progressed with
unprecedented speed: from ASO design to FDA approval and patient delivery was ~11 months.

We established a pipeline with [Scott Demarest, MD](https://www.childrenscolorado.org/doctors-and-departments/physicians/d/scott-demarest/) and the Children's Hospital Colorado Neurogenetics Clinic to 
facilitate development of antisense oligonucleotide therapies for a range of neurogenetic diseases. With support of the 
RBI and Children's Hospital Colorado, we create patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell lines, 

In parallel, we are exploring an alternative strategy to develop ASO modalities for diseases of
haploinsufficiency that are *gene-specific* instead of *mutation-specific*. Such an approach would be
transformative for the field, as it reduces the daunting challenge of individual ASO therapies to the identification
of a minimal set (i.e., one for each gene) of ASOs that can target a gene irrespective of the nature of a specific
mutation. To help achieve this goal, we developed a novel ASO chemistry (thiomorpholino or “TMO”
modifications) with favorable characteristics for manipulating nuclear gene expression. With support from the AB Nexus program, we leverage our complementary, cross-campus expertise to compare the efficacy of TMO modifications to standard
modifications (2′-methoxyethyl or “MOE”) of existing, FDA-approved therapies and leverage unique properties
of TMO ASOs to manipulate nuclear mRNA expression and processing.
